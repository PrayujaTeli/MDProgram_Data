# MD Student Lifecycle Dashboard 📊

This Tableau Public dashboard provides a concise overview of student performance and satisfaction across the MD program, designed specifically for Directors of Assessment and Medical Education leadership.

## 🔍 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard answers 3 key questions:

1. **How do students compare across key performance indicators (KPI) throughout the MD program?**
   - 📈 Visualizes average GPA from Year 1 to Year 4 across different **Program Tracks** (Global Health, Research, Traditional).
   - 🎯 Highlights trends in academic progress over time and variation between tracks.

2. **What is the relationship between student satisfaction and outcomes?**
   - 📊 Displays **student satisfaction** (Dissatisfied → Very Satisfied) by:
     - **Gender**
     - **Ethnicity**
     - **Admission Path**
   - 📌 Each bar shows both the **number of students** and **percentage of students** in each satisfaction group, making interpretation intuitive.

3. **Do admission paths or demographics influence satisfaction or performance?**
   - 📌 Satisfaction is broken down by **Direct**, **International**, and **Post-Bac** admission paths.
   - 🎯 Helps identify areas of concern, such as spikes in dissatisfaction or neutral ratings by demographic groups.
